The following error does not matter, the website still builds:

hugo v0.95.0-9F2E76AF+extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate=2022-03-16T14:20:19Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
WARNING: calling IsSet with unsupported type "invalid" (<nil>) will always return false.
Error: Error copying static files: chmod /Users/chri862z/hugo-academic/public/webfonts/fa-v4compatibility.ttf: operation not permitted


In order to upload, build the website in the "hugo_academic" directory, and then git push the "public" repo to github. The website will update in ~10 minutes.
The site is built by running "hugo" in the terminal within the "hugo_academic" directory.

Otherwise, use "hugo server" in the terminal to get a preview before pushing. This can be run within the hugo-academic directory, not the public directory.
