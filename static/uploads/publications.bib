 @article{Jespersen_Stevenson_2020, title={Investigating Radius Increases in Hot Exoplanets}, volume={235}, abstractNote={Exoplanetary radii is the most commonly measured property of exoplanets, and thus our understanding of how to interpret any measured radius is crucial to the field. Atmospheric existence is often inferred from radius and mass observations, but this is based on the assumption that the interior of planets do not maintain most of the gravitational energy from their collapse. Recently, there have been doubts about this assumption. This project aims to investigate the potential consequences of planets retaining most of the energy from their collapse. Assuming the Murnaghan EOS, we find that stable rocky planets that maintain some of their gravitational energy can have sizeable radius increases, as much as 21% for a planet of 10 M⊕. Furthermore, limits on the amount of energy that can be maintained by a planet will be discussed.}, note={ADS Bibcode: 2020AAS...23517407J}, author={Jespersen, C. K. and Stevenson, D.

However, there is substantial overlap in the properties of both short and long GRBs and neither duration nor any other parameter so far considered completely separates the two groups. Here we unambiguously classify every GRB using a machinelearning dimensionality reduction algorithm, t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding, providing a catalog separating all Swift GRBs into two groups. Although the classiﬁcation takes place only using prompt emission light curves, every burst with an associated supernova is found in the longer group and bursts with kilonovae in the short, suggesting along with the duration distributions that these two groups are truly long and short GRBs. Two bursts with a clear absence of a supernova belong to the longer class, indicating that these might have been directcollapse black holes, a proposed phenomenon that may occur in the deaths of more massive stars.}, number={2}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Jespersen, Christian K. and Severin, Johann B. and Steinhardt, Charles L. and Vinther, Jonas and Fynbo, Johan P.

Predictions for planned and proposed surveys have typically focused on average galaxy counts, assuming a random distribution of galaxies across the observed field. The first and most-massive galaxies, however, are expected to be tightly clustered, an effect known as cosmic variance. We show that cosmic variance is likely to be the dominant contribution to uncertainty for high-redshift mass and luminosity functions, and that median high-redshift and high-mass galaxy counts for planned observations lie significantly below average counts. Several different strategies are considered for improving our understanding of the first galaxies, including adding depth, area, and independent pointings. Adding independent pointings is shown to be the most efficient both for discovering the single highest-redshift galaxy and also for constraining mass and luminosity functions.}, number={1}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, publisher={American Astronomical Society}, author={Steinhardt, Charles L. and Jespersen, Christian Kragh and Linzer, Nora B.}, year={2021}, month={Dec}, pages={8} }

Since the last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data have been collected in the COSMOS field. This paper describes the collection, processing, and analysis of these new imaging data to produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Source detection and multiwavelength photometry are performed for 1.7 million sources across the 2 deg2 of the COSMOS field, ∼966,000 of which are measured with all available broadband data using both traditional aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric extraction tool, The Farmer, which we have developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting photometric catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are computed for all sources in each catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency in the resulting photometric redshifts. The i  21 sources have subpercent photometric redshift accuracy and even the faintest sources at 25 < i < 27 reach a precision of 5%. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of previous, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field. Compared to COSMOS2015, it reaches the same photometric redshift precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric catalogs and their photometric redshift solutions and physical parameters will be made available through the usual astronomical archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC-IRSA, and CDS).}, number={1}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series}, publisher={American Astronomical Society}, author={Weaver, J.

With new HI line and archival optical integral field spectroscopy data, we characterize the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy of one of these events, GRB 111005A, in order to shed light on the unclear nature of these peculiar objects. We found that the atomic gas, radio continuum, and rotational patterns are in general very smooth throughout the galaxy, which does not indicate a recent gas inflow or outflow. There is also no gas concentration around the GRB position. The ISM in this galaxy differs from that in hosts of other GRBs and SNe, which may suggest that the progenitor of GRB 111005A was not an explosion of a very massive star (e.g. a compact object merger). However, there are subtle irregularities of the GRB 111005A host (most at a $2sigma$ level), which may point to a weak gas inflow or interaction. Since in the SE part of the host there is 15% more atomic gas and twice less molecular gas than in NW part, the molecular gas fraction is low. In the SE part there is also a region with very high H$alpha$ equivalent width. There is more continuum 1.4 GHz emission to the SE and an S-shaped warp in the UV. Finally, there is also a low-metallicity region 3.5" (1 kpc) from the GRB position. Two galaxies within 300 kpc or a past merger can be responsible for these irregularities.}, note={arXiv: 2202.01188}, journal={arXiv:2202.01188 [astro-ph]}, author={Lesniewska, Aleksandra and Michalowski, M.
