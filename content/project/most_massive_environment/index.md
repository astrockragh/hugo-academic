title: The optical and infrared are connected
summary: Galaxies are often modelled as disjoint composites of distinct spectral components, implying that different wavelength ranges are only weakly correlated. **They are not**. We construct a data-driven model to predict infrared emission from optical spectra, achieving almost lossless predictions. Traditional fitting methods are incapable of making predictions, being biased by model misspecifications.

# Explaining the masses of ultra-massive "universe-breaking" galaxies

What do you do when observations break your theory?

Thatâ€™s the situation galaxy physics has faced since the JWST started discovering both extremely distant galaxies, along with **ultra-massive, quiescent galaxies** at redshifts 3â€“5 â€” galaxies more massive than our Milky Way, already completely quenched just 1 billion years after the Big Bang. We have struggled to explain how these galaxies could form stars so rapidly and shut off star formation this early. Theories have invoked extreme star formation efficiencies (close to 100%!), very exotic feedback mechanisms, or even modifications to our well-tested Î›CDM-cosmology. This has all come from statistical analyses of an idealized distribution of galaxies by total mass, the stellar mass function (SMF), using a technique called **Extreme Value Statistics (EVS)**, which is designed to ask the question:

#### But what if weâ€™ve just been asking the wrong question?

## ðŸŒŒ The Real Question: Where Are These Galaxies Found?

Every single one of these ultra-massive, quiescent galaxies â€” including those in the **JWST EXCELS sample** â€” lives in a **cosmic overdensity**, regions with significantly more galaxies than average. And yet, most theoretical predictions have treated these galaxies as if they live in average environments.

Thatâ€™s like estimating the height of the tallest person *in the world* by looking at a single average village. You're going to be surprised.

## ðŸ”¥ The EVS Trick That Changes Everything

This paper introduces an extended version of EVS that includes a galaxyâ€™s **environment** â€” specifically, the overdensity it lives in â€” when estimating the expected maximum stellar mass. Instead of marginalizing over environments (which dilutes everything), we condition on the known fact that the galaxy is in an extreme region.

How?

1. **Estimate the volume** of the overdensity using 3D redshift-space distributions.
2. **Compute how rare** such an overdensity is in the full survey â€” i.e., the **density percentile** `u_Î´`.
3. **Construct a stellar mass function (SMF)** that depends on `u_Î´`. More overdense = more high-mass galaxies.
4. Use EVS on this **overdensity-dependent SMF** to compute the distribution of the **most massive galaxy**.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Result: They're Not So Impossible After All

When we apply this method to three galaxies in the UDS field â€” including the infamous PRIMER-EXCELS-109760 and ZF-UDS-7329 â€” the tension with theoretical models *drops dramatically*.

* Under the standard EVS (ignoring environment), some galaxies were **5â€“6Ïƒ** above expectation. Alarming!
* When we **condition on overdensity**, this drops to **\~2Ïƒ** or even **zero**.
* You donâ€™t need 100% star formation efficiency anymore. The pre-JWST \~10% value works fine.

## ðŸ’¥ Soâ€¦ Was This a Crisis? Or a Misunderstanding?

Letâ€™s be blunt. Much of the tension arose not because the models were fundamentally wrong, but because we were comparing the rarest galaxies in the universe to average expectations.

By conditioning on where these galaxies actually live â€” **the most overdense regions of the sky** â€” we reconcile theory and observation without invoking extreme physics.

Itâ€™s a small shift in logic. But a huge step in understanding.

## ðŸ›  Want to Try This Yourself?

We've released the full code for environment-conditioned EVS on [GitHub](https://github.com/astrockragh/evs_clustering), including a \[demo notebook]\(link to demo). Itâ€™s simple, transparent, and powerful â€” just like the best statistics.

## ðŸš€ Why This Matters for Galaxy Evolution

* We now have a **physically-motivated way** to model massive galaxy formation without stretching SFE or tweaking dark matter.
* We **connect large-scale structure and galaxy properties** in a statistical framework.
* Future clustering-calibrated SMFs (from JWST or Euclid) can **predict the expected outliers**, not just describe the mean.

This is not the end of the mystery â€” but itâ€™s the **beginning of the right question**.
