We present our recent improvements over the internal IceCube collaborations state of the art in neutrino path reconstruction. The precision and speed gain (10% better precision, $10^6$ times faster) are mainly due to encoding the detector structure as a graph, and learning a high dimensional representation for the track and and energy of the particles.
