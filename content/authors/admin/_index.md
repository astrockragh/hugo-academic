I am a 3rd-year PhD Candidate working at the [Department of Astrophysical Sciences](https://web.astro.princeton.edu) at Princeton University advised by <a href="https://pmelchior.net/">Peter Melchior</a> and David N. Spergel.
I work on applying Machine Learning and new statistical methods to astrophysics, preferably where they have never been tried before. My main astrophysical interests are extragalactic, but I am widely interested in almost all areas of astronomy. My thesis will focus on constructing a link between low-dimensional representations made from dark-matter only cosmological simulations and observed galaxy spectra.<br/>
I am currently affiliated with multiple research groups including the <a href="https://astro-data-lab.github.io/">Astro Data Lab</a>, led by <a href="https://pmelchior.net/">Peter Melchior</a>, and the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/cosmology-x-data-science/"> Cosmology x Data-science</a> group at the 
<a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/"> Flatiron Institute</a> led by 
<a href="https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~sho/index.html"> Shirley Ho</a>. <br/>

I am currently a member of the [Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS)](https://pfs.ipmu.jp/) spectroscopic survey collaboration, the [Learning the Universe (LtU)](https://www.learning-the-universe.org/) collaboration and the [Legacy Survey of Space and Time Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST-DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/).


Originally from Denmark, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/) at the University of Copenhagen in 2021, with a [thesis](https://astrockragh.github.io/project/neutrino_ml/) on Neutrino Detection in IceCube.

Currently, I can be found in the infamous graduate student basement
in Peyton Hall in Princeton, or at the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/"> Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) </a> in New York City.

I am very passionate about showing our wonderful universe to the public, and I frequently lead the [public observing nights at Peyton Hall](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/observatory/publicobserving.php), and I give outreach talks at [Astronomy On Tap Trenton](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/trenton-nj/).

Outside of academia, I like rock climbing, gardening and all kinds of surfing. I even like gardening so much that I have ended up being the coordinator of my [local community garden](https://lakesidecommittee.princeton.edu/lakeside-community-garden/).
