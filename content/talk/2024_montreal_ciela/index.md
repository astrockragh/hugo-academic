<!-- Galaxies’ properties are coupled to each other, as well as to their environments and merger histories. Unfortunately, these couplings are usually ignored in widely used statistical models of galaxies, often due to the difficulties of efficiently expressing them. I will introduce the tools necessary to explicitly introduce detailed descriptions of environments and merger histories into a statistical framework, and prove a surprising connection between the merger histories and environments of galaxies. I will then show how component coupling is implicitly treated in common codes which infer the physical parameters of galaxies, how the correct coupling strength can be empirically proven, and how this implicit treatment impacts the inferred parameters. -->
