abstract: The existence of ultramassive quiescent galaxies, which have already completed their life cycle at a mere 7% of the age of the Universe, is among the most puzzling of recent discoveries. We provide a statistical argument for interpreting these observations in the context of their **environments**, which explains their accelerated formation.
