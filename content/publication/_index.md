I would never keep everything here up to date, so instead look at [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=((author%3A%22Jespersen%2C%20Christian%20K.%22%20or%20author%3A%22Kragh%20Jespersen%2C%20Christian%22)%20AND%20year%3A2020-2023)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0). Some times, web services track my name as Kragh Jespersen, Christian, sometimes as Jespersen, Christian Kragh, and sometimes as Jespersen, Christian K., so I recommend using the above link to get correct results.
