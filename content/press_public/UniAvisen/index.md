abstract: We were interviewed by the university newspaper https://uniavisen.dk/en/solved-astronomy-mystery-after-just-one-year-at-university/, which was also nice enough to translate the interview into English. It was my first time being interviewed for any of the science I have done and it was a lot of fun!
