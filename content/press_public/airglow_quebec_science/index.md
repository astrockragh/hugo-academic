abstract: "I was interviewed about my work on understanding the way the Earths atmosphere glows at night by Québec Science magazine. Check it out at https://www.quebecscience.qc.ca/espace/airglow-lueur-atmosphere/. Airglow is a really great subject for public science magazines, since most people are already fascinated by aurora! It is also a lot of fun to talk more about all the cool stuff that is waiting to be discovered by astronomers - right here on earth."
